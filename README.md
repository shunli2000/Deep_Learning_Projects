# Deep_Learning_Projects
Projects and HWs in [Deep Learning Course]("https://deeplearning.cs.cmu.edu/F24/index.html") in CMU. For project:

Part 1 founs on implementing neural network using **only NumPyâ€”no deep learning frameworks**.

Part 2 is an **open-ended Kaggle competition**. I ranked in the **top 5%** for all competitions on the private leaderboard out of hundreds of submissions in the class Kaggle competition.

## 1 Introduction to Neural Networks

### MLP from Scratch
It includes forward propagation, backpropagation, activation functions, and training with gradient descent, Dropout and Adam and Adamw optimizer.

### Speech Recognition with MLP
 We train a multilayer perceptron (MLP) using PyTorch to classify frame-level phoneme states from Mel spectrogram inputs. The task involves data loading, model architecture design, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation on a large-scale speech dataset derived from WSJ recordings.


## 2 Face Classification and Verification with CNNs

### CNN from Scratch
It includes Conv1d, Conv2d, Pooling and Flatten.

### Speech Recognition with MLP
Trained CNNs to classify face identities from the VGGFace2 dataset and designed a robust face verification pipeline using learned embeddings.
- Applied comprehensive data augmentation to improve generalization
- Built and trained CNN architectures including CNNs, ResNet, and ConvNeXt variants.
- Implemented and compared Advanced loss functions like Cross-Entropy, Triplet Loss, ArcFace.
- Implemented training pipelines with checkpointing and validation accuracy monitoring.
